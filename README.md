# ZemogaTestApp

## Requirements

- iOS 9.0+
- Xcode 8.0+
- Swift 4.1

The architecture is based on the screaming architecture by uncle bob.
The folders are created to agroup multiples files that are co-relationated. 
The services are developed thinking on the protocol oriented to easy implement multiples Adapters of a protocol.


The third libraries that i used was this:
RealmSwift: For handle persistency, i like use this ORM because allows me be more accurate with the queries and is more easy handle.
ObjectMapper: this library allows me parse JSON data structure to DTO easily
MBProgressHUD: this is for show a loading view on the center of the view.
Alamofire: The best http networking library that we can use on iOS development
